## Code Style Guidelines
- Always use function expressions (e.g., arrow functions like `const func = () => {}` or `const func = function() {}`) instead of function declarations (`function
func() {}`) to maintain consistency and avoid potential hoisting issues.
- Always use `pnpm` as my package manager.
- dont change anything unless you have to
